1) 
  1. <div> tag opens but doesn't close
  2. the </button> tag closes, but there is no <button> tag to open
2) If user is observable, then I would save it in the constructor to a new user variable
3) 
Advantages:
  1. subscribes to real-time changes returned by an observable

Disadvantages
  1. the getUserName() function may return an error if the method inside the constructor fails.
